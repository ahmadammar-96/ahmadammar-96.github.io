One way to achieve this is by the application of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method, which combines the advantages of both Lagrangian descripton following an individual parcel as it moves through space and Eulerian description focusing on specific locations in the space. However, this method requires adaptive meshing depending on solid particles displacements as time evolves and therefore leads to a substantial computational cost. To avoid repeated re-meshing, the whole computational domain containing the fluid and the solid is meshed with a fixed structured cartesian grid. As a result, the grid will most probably not conform to the solids boundary. Here, the introduction of the solid phase to the governing flow equations is achieved by adequately formulating the source term marked in the NS equation.\n","date":1580428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580428800,"objectID":"85cca8e0d6e59e8f279c02d422b2804d","permalink":"/project/ibmfoam/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ibmfoam/","section":"project","summary":"A Project of the course Simulation of Thermofluids with Open-Source Software.","tags":["CFD","Immersed Boundary Method","C++"],"title":"Immersed Boundary pisoFoam Solver","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The main task of this project was to conduct a CFD analysis of a pump design on the SimScale platform.
