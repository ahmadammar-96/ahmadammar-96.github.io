      <description>&lt;p&gt;A micro vertical axis wind turbine was designed with a combination of Darrius and Savonius designs. The report included the selected components of the wind turbine with material selection and bill of materials for the fabrication. Furthermore, proper calculations and analysis were done on the blades and the designed structure to ensure the practicality of the design. The steps of fabrication, methods and machines used were explained too.&lt;/p&gt;
